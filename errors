Database Connection Diagnostic
❌ Connection Failed
Error Message: SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond

Troubleshooting Tips:
Unknown Database?: Check if 'adhoc' is the correct name.
Access Denied?: Check password for user '23203159'.
Connection Refused?: If DB is on a company server, change $host = 'localhost' in db.php to the server IP (e.g., 172.23.56.100).
